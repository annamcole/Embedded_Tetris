This repository contains the files required to run a version of the game Tetris on the TI MSP432 launchpad.

Light sensor: sets seed for changing colors of blocks

Accelerometer: moves block laterally on LCD display

Buttons: rotate and drop

Buzzer: annoying tetris theme song playing in the background :) enjoy that one. You're welcome.
